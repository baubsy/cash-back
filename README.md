This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's a single page web app made in Javascript using the React framework. It's styled to have a responsive UI with boot strap. I made it to help cashier's practice counting back cash to customers. It gives a random total and amount paid. The user has to click buttons corresponding to bills/coins and click submit when they think they've got it right. The site lets them know if they got it right or wrong and if wrong it shows how much they were over/under.
